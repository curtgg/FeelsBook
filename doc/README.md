Specifically, this resource assisted with the toString of my enumerable
so they could be stringified in the View directly, rather than by checking type first

3. Date/Time Pickers for Date input
The Android documentation for Date and Time pickers was
extremely resourceful in this assignment. The use of these two
Dialogs allowed for validation of user input when editing of the date
was needed. The code on instantiation and usage of these popups
was borrowed to some extend to allow for its usage.

4. Chaining of date and time pickers
This youtube video has been attributed because although I did not borrow the
code shown in the video (The code in the video is identical to that of citation 3
found in the Android Developer documentation), I would not have used both the
date and time picker in sequence to create the effect shown in the app.
(Date picker immediately leads into Time picker)
